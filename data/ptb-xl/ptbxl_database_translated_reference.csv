There are abnormal patterns in the QRS and T waves, which can suggest changes in the heart's electrical activity. The report mentions evidence of an anterior infarction, which is a past heart attack in the front part of your heart, but the age of this infarction cannot be determined. Additionally, there is a likelihood of an inferior infarction, which means there might have been a past heart attack in the lower part of your heart. The term ""Elderly"" suggests that these findings are more common in older individuals.
